# How to Set up Google or OpenAI Credentials?

Google credentials / OpenAI keys are optional.

We will add user interface for users to specify OpenAI API / Google credentials.

We will also add documentation about this.  Meanwhile, read https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit/wiki/Google-API-Setup for Google credential setup.

To add / change OpenAI API key, enter '.changeapikey' in FreeGenius AI prompt.  Alternately, edit the value of 'openaiApiKey' in config.py.
